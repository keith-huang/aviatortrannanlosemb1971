## What is the Aviator Game?

The Aviator game is a crash-style game that has gained a massive
following since its launch in 2019. In this game, players place bets on
a plane that flies higher and higher. The goal is to cash out before the
plane crashes, and the longer the plane stays in the air, the higher the
multiplier on your bet. However, waiting too long means the plane may
crash, and you lose your bet. The game's simple yet thrilling nature has
made it popular among online casino players, especially in India.
